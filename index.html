		 <p> As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, 
		 who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.</p>
	     
		 <p>The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm
		 to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.</p>

		 <p>In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, 
		 control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, 
		 usability and most importantly maintainability.</p>
		 
		 <p>The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with 
		 discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose, 
		 algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use, such as 
		 execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. </p>
		 
		 <p>The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by testing 
		 to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a lot of differing 
		 approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for requirements analysis is Use Case analysis. </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Programming_languages">
         <header> Programming languages </header>
		 <p> The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, 
		 availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited 
		 for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know
		 the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which 
		 programs written in a given language execute.</p>
		 
		 <p> Languages form an approximate spectrum from "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically 
		 more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use 
		 but execute less quickly. It is usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones.</p>
		 
		<p>The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every 
		language: </p>
		
		<ul>
		    <li>Input: Gather data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.</li>
			<li>Output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.</li>
			<li>Arithmetic: Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.</li>
			<li>Conditional Execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.</li>
			<li>Repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Many computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by shared libraries. Provided the functions 
		in a library follow the appropriate run-time conventions (e.g., method of passing arguments), then these functions may
		be written in any other language.</p>

		 <p>Computer programmers are those who write computer software. Their jobs usually involve:</p>
		 
		 <ul>
		    <li>Prototyping</li>
			<li>Coding</li>
			<li>Debugging</li>
			<li>Documentation </li>
			<li>Integration </li>

         <header> Use CSS </header>
		   <p>There are 3 ways to use CSS</p>
		      <ul>
			    <li>Inline CSS</li>
				<li>Internal CSS</li>
				<li>External CSS</li>
			  </ul>
			  
			  <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
			  <pre>
              <code>&lt;button style="color:purple"&gt;Click me&lt;
			  </code>
			  </pre>
			  
			  <h3>Internal CSS</h3>
			  <p>In your HTML file inside the head tag you should put the style tag:</p>
			  <pre>
			  <code>&lt;style&gt;
			       button {
				     color: purple;
				}
		&lt;/style&gt;
			  </code>
			  </pre>
			  
			  <p>Andthen you can have a button on your pagre:</p>
			  <pre>
			    <code>&lt;button&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;
				</code>
				</pre>
			  
			  <h3>External CSS</h3>
			  <p>In another CSS filewe can have:</p>
			  <pre>
			  <code>
			     button {
				      color: purple;
					    }
			  </code>
			  </pre>
			  
			  <p>And then import it into the HTML using the link tag</p>
			     <pre>
				 <code>
                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet"
                    href="style.css"/&gt;
                    </code>
                    </pre>
